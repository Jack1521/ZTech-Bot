  this.reply(m.chat, 'Types of Exploits\nTypes of Exploits in Metasploit:\n1) Active\n2) Passive\n> The core difference between these two exploit types is that the active type exploits a specific target before it terminates, whereas the passive type waits until an incoming host connects before exploiting. It helps to know these beforehand, as the difference will play a clearer role when you graduate to writing more complicated exploits.\n- Setup\nThe software we will use in this tutorial include the following:\n1) The exploit: For the purpose of this short guide, we will be using a pre-existing vulnerability in the freefloat FTP server.\nImmunity debugger: This is used in creating exploits and reverse-engineering binary files. You can easily come by a good debugger available online for free.\nKali Linux: Obviously, the undisputed leading pen testing aid.\nMona.py: A Python-based plugin that helps with immunity debugging. Download Mona.py and move it to the immunity debugger directory (the py command folder).', m)
